    "## **Bounding Box algorithm**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given an array of equal size plusses, a bounding box can be constructed where plus centers inside the box must intersect at least one other plus of the same size and plus signs that fall outside of the bounding box must necessarily be distinct. This alone massively reduces the compute time of the first pass of the algorithm.\n",
    "- Taking advantage of the fact that plusses of equal size must overlap twice when they intersect, we get a fast solution for computing the largest prodcut of their intersect: \n",
    "    - Let x be the distance between two centers on the x axis, y be the distance between two centers on the y axis\n",
    "    - **Case 1**: x == 0 or y == 0 -- The arms overlap, maximum product is when the arm length is equally divided between the two plus signs. Constant time solution. We can do horizontal and vertical scans in efficient O(n^2) time and store the results in a spatially indexed dictionary, an **R-tree** would naturally work in parallel with the bounding box algorithm as it also uses bounding boxes.\n",
    "    - **Case 2**: x == y -- The centers are directly diagonal to each other. Maximum product results in the trimming of one plus until there's no intersect. Constant time solution, same as case 1.\n",
    "    - **Case 3**: None of the above -- The maximum product is (max(x, y) * 4 + 1) ^ 2. Both plusses are trimmed until they slip past each other. Linear distance metric.\n",
    "        - **Key observation**: A pre-sort of O(n^2 * log(n)) can be used to create a full 2d convex hull. This is the Graham scan method of constructing a convex hull.\n",
    "        - **Key observation**: A convex hull should be computed for each x coordinate and each y coordinate, due to the possibility of overlap at one of the convex hull's points\n",
    "            - At each x and y coordinate, create a convex hull without points (with drop outs) at that coordinate.\n",
    "        - **Key observation**: Each convex hull can have at most sqrt(n^2) = n distinct points due to the reduced dimensionality of the problem.\n",

    "        - **Key observation**: Creating n convex hulls for each volume is O(n) and not O(n^2)\n",
    "        - **key observation**: Creating n^2 convex hulls total for n distinct volumes is O(n^2) and not O(n^3)\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Proof**:\n",
    "        1. **Definition**: A convex hull is a one-dimensional boundary that encloses a set of points on a 2D plane, forming the minimal convex set (Axiomatic).\n",
    "        2. **Extremal Points Limit**: By definition, the convex hull of a set of points on a plane can have at most n extremal points (Derived from 1).\n",
    "        3. **Lesser Convex Hulls**: When any point is excluded from the grid, a new convex hull formed has no more than n extremal points (Consequence of 2).\n",
    "        4. **Distinct Extremal Points**: Removing points that are two units apart results in convex hulls with distinct new extremal points, except at a shared boundary (Geometric property from 1).\n",
    "        5. **Batch Processing**: Constructing two distinct convex hulls by alternately removing odd and even-indexed points ensures all scenarios are covered with minimal overlap (Efficiency improvement using 3 and 4).\n",
    "        6. **Coverage**: These two distinct lesser convex hulls collectively represent all potential configurations arising from the individual removal of any point (Comprehensive coverage using 5).\n",
    "        7. **Information Content**: The total informational content (number of unique extremal points) within these hulls is O(n), reflecting linear complexity (Summation of minimal overlaps from 6).\n",
    "        8. **Construction Complexity**: Building O(n) of these convex hulls requires linear time, O(n), due to the limited number of points processed (Efficiency derived from iterative approach in 4, 5, and 7).\n",
    "        9. **Conclusion**: Considering all individual convex hulls constructed by excluding each point, the entire dataset exhibits linear complexity in both construction and informational content (Final conclusion from 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Conclusion**: This proof demonstrates that handling convex hulls derived by excluding points from a grid is linear complexity, O(n). This property significantly enhances the efficiency of any algorithm requiring geometric boundary analyses in grid-based data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Example**: given a plus at (3, 3) with volume 9, a plus at (4,6) is identical to a plus at (5,6) because the optimal solution for both is to truncate to the largest of the x and y differences. Notable exceptions are overlapping plusses at (3, 3) and (3, 4) as well as directly diagonal plusses (3, 3) and (4, 4) which can be handled separately through a number of sweep line algorithms horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, this bounding box algorithm for a fixed volume is linear runtime, and constructing n convex hulls is linear runtime due to their overlapping information. They can be represented by a dictionary with O(n) space.\n"

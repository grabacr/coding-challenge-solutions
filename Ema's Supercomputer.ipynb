    "The implementation of Ema's Quantum computer is a complex one, as many complex factors kick in. Currently, all proposed solutions brute force the matter, but we can do better. Inside the problem, there are many parallels to other problems, and notably, several tools and strategies can be used to rapidly decrease the search time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem description: Ema has a grid of good 'G' and bad 'B' cells of size m * n. We need to find the largest product of the volume of two non-overlapping plus signs. A plus sign is a symmetric plus sign of width 1 with all arms of the same length and a centerpoint at which all four arms meet.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of the most notable tools available:\n",
    "- Dictionary Indexing\n",
    "- L1 norm spatial sorting\n",
    "- Key sorting and greedy algorithms\n",
    "- Early stopping heuristics\n",
    "- Spatially bounded algorithms that reduce n^4 computation to n^3\n",
    "- Convex Hulls with reduced dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Finding plusses\n",
    "The comparison tools to find plusses in an optimal manner largely dilute to a single strategy: Trading time complexity for space complexity.\n",
    "The n x m grid naturally has a minimum of O(n * m) to process. So below, the populate function does just that.\n",
    "- An initial row by row pass finds and memorizes all the rightmost indexes of a segment and notes both the segment length and rightmost index for each cell in the segment\n",
    "- A second column by column pass finds the same for each column and enters the largest possible plus at each cell into the dictionary of class Plus\n",
    "This strategy takes advantage of the fact that given two endpoints and a length, a cell centerpoint of a plus is able to compute its own maximal size in constant time.\n",
    "As a result, the dictionary Plus.plusses and Plus.decr_plus are both populated in O(n * m) time\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Finding the largest product.\n",
    "A naive implementation of this would be to brute force the combinations of every single plus sign and smaller plus sign inside each plus sign.\n",
    "This would be an ((n * m) choose 2) problem, leading to an (n^2 * m^2) result. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization: Heuristics\n",
    "- Plus.decr_plus is specially designed to have a key which is the volume of the plus signs. It is provable are at most min(n, m) different size plusses.\n",
    "- As a result, the runtime of the sort is O(min(n, m) * log(min(n, m))), well within bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing so allows us to first consider the largest possible candidates and if they overlap, consecutively going smaller until further searches are no longer required.\n",
    "In the vast majority of cases this is enough, leading to a near consant time search for the largest possible plus.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we want to do better than this and push the absolute limits of algorithmic optimization. Below is a concept of how to approach this.\n",
    "To be implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bounding Box algorithm:\n",
    "- Given an array of equal size plusses, a bounding box can be constructed where plus centers inside the box must intersect at least one other plus of the same size and plus signs that fall outside of the bounding box must necessarily be distinct. This alone massively reduces the compute time of the first pass of the algorithm.\n",
    "- Taking advantage of the fact that plusses of equal size must overlap twice when they intersect, we get a fast solution for computing the largest prodcut of their intersect: \n",
    "    - Let x be the distance between two centers on the x axis, y be the distance between two centers on the y axis\n",
    "    - Case 1: x == 0 or y == 0 -- The arms overlap, maximum product is when the arm length is equally divided between the two plus signs. Constant time solution.\n",
    "    - Case 2: x == y -- The centers are directly diagonal to each other. Maximum product results in the trimming of one plus until there's no intersect. Constant time solution.\n",
    "    - Case 3: None of the above -- The maximum product is (max(x, y) * 4 + 1) ^ 2. Both plusses are trimmed until they slip past each other. Linear distance metric.\n",
    "        - Key observation: A 1d convex hull can be recorded with 1d dimensionality and constant time insertion\n",
    "        - Key obvservation: Instead of doing a full convex hull, a 90 degree convex hull from each corner of the bounding box is sufficient to reduce runtime.\n",
    "        - Key observation: The convex hull created contains the mutually furthest distances (wrt maximum product) between a point and its corner.\n",
    "        - A convex hull should be created for each corner, \n",
    "    - Example: given a plus at (3, 3) with volume 9, a plus at (4,6) is identical to a plus at (5,6) because the optimal solution for both is to truncate to the largest of the x and y differences. Notable exceptions are overlapping plusses at (3, 3) and (3, 4) as well as directly diagonal plusses (3, 3) and (4, 4) which can be handled separately through a number of sweep line algorithms horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.\n",
    "As a result, this bounding box algorithm for a fixed volume is linear runtime, and constructing the convex hull is also linear runtime due to the restraints of the maximization function which allow a significantly faster than euclidean distance insertion of log(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity's sake, we'll consider n == m, with the brute force being O(n^4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now onto the final step:\n",
    "- Each distinct volume can have its own bounding box created in linear runtime over n * m elements. -- current runtime O(n^2)\n",
    "- There are n distinct bounding boxes and convex hulls in the worst case\n",
    "- Each convex hull has sqrt(n^2) = n possible elements including overlaps. Convex hulls are dimesnionally 1 smaller than the box they cover, so sqrt(n) is the most plusses.\n",
    "- For each convex hull, at most n operations are permitted to reach a global runtime of O(n^3)\n",
    "- Comparing two convex hulls for largest L1 and next largest L2 plus volumes:\n",
    "    - As of now, the brute force method takes O(n^(7/2)), which is a major improvement over the previous n^4, but we can do better.\n",
    "    - Shrink the bounding box of L1 to match L2 and take a sorted permutation: Convex hull might go outside bounding box.\n",
    "        - For each of n bounding boxes, run a sorted permutation over all combinations L1 (larger) and L2 (smaller) volumes.\n",
    "        - Case 1: Both convex hulls fall inside both bounding boxes\n",
    "            - sqrt(n) recategorization of sqrt(n) plusses under 1d convex hull rules -- current runtime O(n^(5/2))\n",
    "        - Case 2: Some convex hull plus centerpoints fall outside of the opposing bounding box\n",
    "            - At minimum, we have L2 * L2 = max product\n",
    "            - A final n runtime permutation brute force stays below the O(n^3) limit, -- current runtime O(n^(5/2))\n",
    "        - Case 3: Some conves hull plus centerpoints fall outside of its own shrunk bounding box\n",
    "            - At minimum, we have L2 * L2 = max product\n",
    "            - A final n runtime permutation brute force stays below the O(n^3) limit, -- current runtime O(n^(5/2))\n",
